# ConvertJavaTextureToBedrock
This repository was created to archive the now deleted "ConvertJavaTextureToBedrock" repository.

The version of the repo that was archived was: v4.2.0

https://7man7lmyt.github.io/ConvertJavaTextureToBedrock/


I managed to archive this due to my browser caching v4.2.0 in my browser, so with some help, I saved the scripts and code.
It doesn't appear to work on my end, but https://rtm516.github.io/ConvertJavaTextureToBedrock/ is this exact repo that I've sent to rtm516, but it actually works.
